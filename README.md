# Project Title: GitHub Repository Manager

## Description:
This project is a web application built with React and TypeScript, aimed at providing users with an intuitive interface to manage their GitHub repositories. It allows users to authenticate with their GitHub accounts using OAuth, view a list of their repositories, and delete repositories directly from the application.

## Key Features:

- OAuth Authentication: Users can log in to the application securely using their GitHub accounts.
- Repository Listing: Once authenticated, users can view a list of their GitHub repositories.
- Repository Deletion: Users can delete repositories directly from the application, providing a convenient way to manage their GitHub projects.

## Technologies Used:

- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript, providing enhanced developer tooling and type safety.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- React Router: Declarative routing for React applications.
- GitHub API: Utilized for authentication and fetching/deleting repositories.

## How to Use:

- Visit the application URL and click on "Login with GitHub" to authenticate.
- After authentication, you will be redirected to a page displaying your GitHub repositories.
- You can then delete repositories directly from the application by clicking on the "Delete Permanently" button next to each repository.
